# Travel-Buddy
A Meshtastic comunicator with a keypad, solar panel and an Eink display.  
Based on the SeedStudio Wio tracker L1.  

I made a write up on Hackster for a [Hackster competetion](https://www.hackster.io/contests/SeeedMeshtasticDeviceDesign2025) and a Heltec V3 device from FEL Camp.  

Basicaly its a self sustaining Meshtastic hanheld client. Featuring solar panel and a power efficient Seeed Studio Wio Tracker L1 E-Ink as its brain.  
To be trurly self sustaining node with a T9 style keyboard. So no phone needed!
